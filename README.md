## Description
This is an example widget that demonstrates how to write an Android widget that can be reconfigured on the fly by touching a button.  This also demonstrates how the button can continue to work despite the widget being constantly updated by a service.

## Installation 
Import the project into Eclipse, build and run in the
Android simulator or directly on your device.  With the simulator use
Ctrl-F11 to simulate rotating the device. Note that the project no
longer requires the appcompat version 7 library.
